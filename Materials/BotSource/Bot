:hello my name is "BOT". Can I help you?
hello:hello I can tell you what the set, map, unordered_map or vector is in C++ STL and what time is it 
commands:"BOT set", "BOT map", "BOT vector", "BOT unordered_map", "BOT Time"
set:Sets are a type of associative container in which each element has to be unique because the value of the element identifies it. The values are stored in a specific sorted order i.e. either ascending or descending. Time complexity: O(N) // N is the size of the set. Insertion of Elements – O(log N) Deletion of Elements – O(log N)
map:Maps are associative containers that store elements in a mapped fashion. Each element has a key value and a mapped value. No two mapped values can have the same key values. Balanced Binary Search tree (BST) Insert. elements with a particular key in the map container –> O(log n). for searching elements in std::map is O(log n)
unordered_map:std::unordered_map best case time complexity for searching is O(1) because elements are stored in a Hash table and therefore the key acts as an index while searching in unordered maps.
vector:Vectors are the same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container. Vector elements are placed in contiguous storage so that they can be accessed and traversed using iterators. In vectors, data is inserted at the end. Inserting at the end takes differential time, as sometimes the array may need to be extended. Removing the last element takes only constant time because no resizing happens. Inserting and erasing at the beginning or in the middle is linear in time.
